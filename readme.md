Intelligent Tutoring Systems for Math

Overview

This project is an interactive application designed to help users learn about basic geometric shapes: triangles, circles, and squares. It includes educational content, images, and a quiz feature.

Features
Learning Modules: Information about shapes, their properties, and formulas.
Visual Aids: Images for each shape.
Quiz: Multiple-choice questions to test knowledge.

Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language.
Tkinter: GUI toolkit for the application.
rdflib: For loading and querying RDF data.
Pillow: For image handling.
Requests: For fetching images from the web.

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/amitsinkija/ITS-for-Math.git

Install required packages:
pip install rdflib Pillow requests

Ensure shapes.owl and the shape images (Triangle.png, Circle.png, Square.png, Square1.png) are in the same directory as the script.

Run the application:
python ITS_math.py
